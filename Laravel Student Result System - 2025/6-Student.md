Here’s the **SQL equivalent** of your Laravel `students` table migration (without foreign key constraints commented out):

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    roll_no VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    grade_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    academic_year_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    group_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```

### Optional: Add foreign key constraints (uncommented version in Laravel)

If you'd like to reflect the foreign keys too (like you hinted in the commented lines), here’s the SQL with constraints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    roll_no VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    grade_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    academic_year_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    group_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    CONSTRAINT fk_grade FOREIGN KEY (grade_id) REFERENCES grades(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_academic_year FOREIGN KEY (academic_year_id) REFERENCES academic_years(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_group FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Let me know if you'd like insert or select SQL for this table as well.
