Here‚Äôs the **SQL equivalent** of your Laravel `students` table migration (without foreign key constraints commented out):

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    roll_no VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    grade_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    academic_year_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    group_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```

### Optional: Add foreign key constraints (uncommented version in Laravel)

If you'd like to reflect the foreign keys too (like you hinted in the commented lines), here‚Äôs the SQL with constraints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    roll_no VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    grade_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    academic_year_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    group_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    CONSTRAINT fk_grade FOREIGN KEY (grade_id) REFERENCES grades(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_academic_year FOREIGN KEY (academic_year_id) REFERENCES academic_years(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_group FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Let me know if you'd like insert or select SQL for this table as well.


---

Sure! Here's the **SQL `INSERT` query** for the `students` table, assuming that the `grades`, `academic_years`, and `groups` tables already contain valid records with matching `id`s.

---

### ‚úÖ Example Insert SQL:
```sql
INSERT INTO students (roll_no, name, grade_id, academic_year_id, group_id, created_at, updated_at) VALUES
('1001', 'Arun Kumar', 1, 1, 1, NOW(), NOW()),
('1002', 'Priya Sharma', 2, 1, 2, NOW(), NOW()),
('1003', 'Rahul Verma', 3, 1, 1, NOW(), NOW()),
('1004', 'Sneha Reddy', 4, 1, 3, NOW(), NOW()),
('1005', 'Karthik R', 5, 1, 1, NOW(), NOW());
```

---

### üîñ Notes:
- You can change the `grade_id`, `academic_year_id`, and `group_id` values depending on your actual foreign key data.
- `NOW()` is used to auto-fill `created_at` and `updated_at`.

Would you also like:
- a **`SELECT` query** (with JOINs to show names from foreign tables)?
- a **Laravel Seeder** version of this?
- or a **bulk insert for 50 students** for testing?


---

Here‚Äôs a **SELECT query** for the `students` table that joins related data from the `grades`, `academic_years`, and `groups` tables ‚Äî so you can see full details like student name, grade name, academic year, and group name.

---

### ‚úÖ Full Join Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    students.id,
    students.roll_no,
    students.name AS student_name,
    grades.name AS grade_name,
    academic_years.name AS academic_year,
    groups.name AS group_name,
    students.created_at,
    students.updated_at
FROM students
JOIN grades ON students.grade_id = grades.id
JOIN academic_years ON students.academic_year_id = academic_years.id
JOIN groups ON students.group_id = groups.id;
```

---

### üîç What it shows:
- Student ID, roll number, and name
- Corresponding grade name
- Academic year name
- Group name
- Created & updated timestamps

Let me know if you want:
- filters (`WHERE` clause) for a specific grade or year
- pagination (`LIMIT`, `OFFSET`)
- ordering (e.g., by `roll_no` or `grade`)  
Happy to tweak it for your use case!
