Here is the **SQL equivalent** of your Laravel migration for creating the `subjects` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE subjects (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '0',
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```

### Notes:
- The `group_id` line is commented out, so itâ€™s excluded from the SQL.
- The `status` column is a `VARCHAR` with default `'0'` (because `false` is cast to string `'0'`).
- `timestamps()` adds `created_at` and `updated_at` as nullable timestamps.

Let me know if you plan to re-enable the `group_id` foreign keyâ€”I'll help with the SQL for that too.



Here's the **SQL equivalent** to insert your `$subjects` data into the `subjects` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO subjects (name, status, created_at, updated_at) VALUES
('ENGLISH', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('MATHS', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('PHYS TOT', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('CHE TOT', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('BIO', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('CS', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('ACCOUNTANCY', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('ECONOMICS', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('BS', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('ENT', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('PAINT', '1', NOW(), NOW()),
('FASHION STUDIES', '1', NOW(), NOW());
```

### Notes:
- Since your `status` field is defined as `string`, `true` becomes `'1'`.
- `NOW()` sets current timestamps for both `created_at` and `updated_at`.

Let me know if youâ€™d like the `status` column changed to a boolean or enum in the migration for cleaner logic.

Here are some useful **`SELECT` SQL queries** for your `subjects` table:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Select all subjects**
```sql
SELECT * FROM subjects;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Select only active subjects (`status = '1'`)**
```sql
SELECT * FROM subjects
WHERE status = '1';
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Select inactive subjects (`status = '0'`)**
```sql
SELECT * FROM subjects
WHERE status = '0';
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Find subject by name (e.g., "CS")**
```sql
SELECT * FROM subjects
WHERE name = 'CS';
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **List subjects ordered by most recently added**
```sql
SELECT * FROM subjects
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Count how many subjects are active**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS active_subjects
FROM subjects
WHERE status = '1';
```

Let me know if you want to include a `group_id` relationship and filter subjects by group as well.
