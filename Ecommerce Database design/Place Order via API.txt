Certainly! Here's an example of how you can make a POST request using Postman to place an order using the API:

1. Start the Java Spring application and ensure it's running on the specified port (e.g., `localhost:8080`).

2. Open Postman and create a new request.

3. Set the request URL to `http://localhost:8080/api/orders`.

4. Set the request method to `POST`.

5. In the request body tab, select `raw` and set the content type to `JSON`.

6. Construct a JSON payload similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "orderItems": [
    {
      "productId": 1,
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "productId": 2,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, we are placing an order for user with ID `1` and adding two order items. Each order item consists of a product ID and the quantity.

7. Click on the "Send" button to make the request.

8. You should receive a response with the order details, including the order ID and the total amount.

Please note that you may need to adjust the request URL and payload based on your specific configuration and requirements.
