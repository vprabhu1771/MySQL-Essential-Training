Certainly! Based on the updated requirement to establish a relationship between the Category and Product entities, we can modify the database design as follows:

User table:

| 1       | johndoe  | password | john@example.com | 123 Main Street  |

| Payment ID | Order ID | Payment Method | Transaction Details        |
|------------|----------|----------------|----------------------------|
| 1          | 1        | Credit Card    | xxxxxxxxxxxx1234           |
| 2          | 2        | PayPal         | jane@example.com - 2023-07 |

In the updated design, the Product table includes a new column "Category ID," which serves as a foreign key referencing the Category ID in the Category table. This establishes a relationship between the two entities, allowing products to be associated with their respective categories.
