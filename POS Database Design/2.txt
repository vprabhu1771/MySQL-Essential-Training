Certainly! To retrieve all sale items for a specific sale along with product details, you can use a `JOIN` query. Below is an example SQL query that retrieves sale items for a specific sale, including details about the associated products:

```sql
-- Assuming you know the sale_id for the specific sale, let's say sale_id = 1
SELECT
    sale_items.id AS sale_item_id,
    products.id AS product_id,
    products.name AS product_name,
    sale_items.quantity,
    sale_items.price
FROM
    sale_items
JOIN
    products ON sale_items.product_id = products.id
WHERE
    sale_items.sale_id = 1;
```

This query performs an inner join between the `sale_items` and `products` tables based on the `product_id` foreign key. It selects relevant information from both tables for the specified `sale_id` (in this case, `sale_id = 1`). Adjust the `WHERE` clause accordingly to match the specific sale you are interested in.

The selected columns include:

- `sale_items.id`: Sale item ID
- `products.id`: Product ID
- `products.name`: Product name
- `sale_items.quantity`: Quantity of the product in the sale
- `sale_items.price`: Price of the product in the sale

Feel free to customize the query based on the specific information you need or add additional conditions as necessary.
